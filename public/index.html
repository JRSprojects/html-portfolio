<hr>

<h3>Planet of the Apes "Series"</h3>

<p>
    The Planet of the Apes series is by far 1 of my favorite<br>
    series of movies filmed and directed in my opinion,<br>
    they did an outstanding job with this movie 5/5 Rating<br>   
</p>

<h3>Fast & Furious "Series"</h3>
<p>
    Hands down I truly belive that the F&F Saga<br>
    is legendary and I think every american family<br>
    can agree. This series has definitely impacted<br>
    millions of people inspirational wise and emotionally.<br>
</p>

<h3>Maze Runner "Series"</h3>
<p>
    No doubt in my mind that Maze Runner is Top 3,<br>
    I loved the series so much I don't know how many<br>
    times I watched it. This series never failed to<br>
    entertain me. The actors and directors made a<br>
    series to remember.
